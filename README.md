# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# React project with Youtube Data API


## A React application to search and browse Dog related Youtube videos using the API


This project allows a user to search for dog related videos and browse the videos in the app itself. Prime features of this appllication:
* The Home component manages video fetching, search submission, and display of selected videos through its state management and interaction handling methods.
* The SearchBar component processes user input by appending "dog" to the search query before triggering a callback function, potentially refining search results to include content related to dogs.
* The VideoRender component embeds a YouTube video player using the video's ID and displays its details, including title, description, and channel, leveraging data from the video prop.
