# React project with Youtube Data API
## React + Vite

## A React application to search and browse Dog related Youtube videos using the API


This project enables users to search for dog related videos and browse them directly within the application. Prime features of this application:
* The Home component manages video fetching, search submission, and display of selected videos through its state management and interaction handling methods.
* The SearchBar component processes user input by appending "dog" to the search query before triggering a callback function, potentially refining search results to include content related to dogs.
* The VideoRender component embeds a YouTube video player using the video's ID and displays its details, including title, description, and channel, leveraging data from the video prop.
